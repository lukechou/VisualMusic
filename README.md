# How to use it and the configuration of needed of your pc

    Once you has run the project successed,you can play the songs list on the page's left or local audio files(songs) through the button of "more". And the basic functions of volumn control, start/stop music and progress of one song are also supplied.

    I use the v0.12.0 nodejs and 4.12.1 express to construct the project. So you got to set up the nodejs and express before starting your project,and then add a supervisor on the project is really recommended in order to restart automatically every time your has changed the file.

    The main JS files' url are public/javascripts/,including the MusicVisualizer.js and index.js. They made the function of playing music and drawing kinds of animation become true.

    The main audio files are restored in public/media,which means the songs you can see on the list of page's left.
